## Hosting A server node

Im assuming this is what most of you are here for so here it goes.

- simply its going to scripts/ops and running ./create-server.sh and following through the args in that

- then once having setup the node running ./start-server.sh {server-name}

- In an ideal world this should just be this simple if its not please open a issue or pull request and i'll get to fixing it


## Support the project

**[NOTE THIS PURELY OPTIONAL ANYTHING DONE WILL BE A MASSIVE HELP IN THE DAY TO DAY RUNNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THIS]**

The sole and only way to really support OpenCom is through the boost subscription service offered within the application, this is designed to help fund the platform as I have done it to make it as fully functioanl without boost whilst also making it worth it to those looking to support :). 


## Actually running the project

**[THIS IS DESIGNED FOR IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IT ALREADY SETUP IN A ENV]**

- Cd into the dir

- Run ./start.sh [ or docker-compose up / docker compose up (if thats working)]

- In either case ensure it runs correctly 

## Dev reset / reconfigure

- If your local config is cooked and you just want to wipe it all and rebuild it cleanly, run `./scripts/dev/reconfigure.sh --yes`

- That will regenerate `backend/.env` + `frontend/.env`, clear local backend runtime state, recreate the local database stack, and rerun migrations

- If you want the optional local object storage too, use `./scripts/dev/reconfigure.sh --yes --with-minio`

## Docker launchers

- You can now use `./docker/dev` for local Docker-driven development and `./docker/prod` for Docker-run hosting

- Both support `all` or `node`

- `all` starts the full stack: databases, redis, core, node, and frontend

- `node` starts the backend-only stack: databases, redis, core, and node

- First `./docker/dev up ...` run does a best-effort backup and then a full `reconfigure`

- First `./docker/prod up ...` run just does the best-effort backup and leaves your config alone

- Example: `./docker/dev all`

- Example: `./docker/dev up node`

- Example: `./docker/prod up all`

- Example: `./docker/prod status`
