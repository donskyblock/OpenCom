## How custom themes work

2. The CSS is inserted into a `<style id="opencom-theme-style">` tag in `document.head`.
3. The CSS string is saved in `localStorage` key `opencom_custom_theme_css`.
4. Click **Reset Theme** to remove custom CSS.

## Typical Discord-like flow in this client
1. Login/register.
2. Add a server by entering a name + node base URL.
3. Select server from left rail.
4. Pick a text channel and chat.
5. Create invite code and share with others.
6. Recipients join with invite code.
7. Configure profile/rich presence and optional custom CSS theme.
