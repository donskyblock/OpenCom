## Environment variables
Create `.env` in `frontend/` (optional):

```bash
VITE_CORE_API_URL=https://openapi.donskyblock.xyz
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=https://opencom.donskyblock.xyz
```

## Run locally
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Monorepo helper scripts
From the repository root, you can also use:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh frontend
./scripts/start.sh frontend
```

Windows:

```bat
scripts\setup.bat frontend
scripts\start.bat frontend
```

## How custom themes work
1. In the **Custom CSS Theme** card, upload a `.css` file, or paste CSS in the textarea.
2. The CSS is inserted into a `<style id="opencom-theme-style">` tag in `document.head`.
3. The CSS string is saved in `localStorage` key `opencom_custom_theme_css`.
4. Click **Reset Theme** to remove custom CSS.

## Typical Discord-like flow in this client
1. Login/register.
2. Add a server by entering a name + node base URL.
3. Select server from left rail.
4. Pick a text channel and chat.
5. Create invite code and share with others.
6. Recipients join with invite code.
7. Apply optional custom CSS theme for personalized UI.


## Admin panel password gate
The dedicated admin page (`/admin.html`) is protected by a server-side password gate.

- Set `ADMIN_PANEL_PASSWORD` in `backend/.env`.
- The admin page sends it as `x-admin-panel-password` on admin API requests.
- Without a valid password, admin endpoints return `BAD_PANEL_PASSWORD`.


## Env bootstrap helper
From repo root you can auto-generate `frontend/.env` and backend secrets with:

```bash
./scripts/init-env.sh
```

Windows:

```bat
scripts\init-env.bat
```
